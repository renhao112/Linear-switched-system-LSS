The code for our paper "On Krylov subspace implemwntation of ParaExp for linear switched systems" subjected to IEEE Control System Letters
## A large-scale linear switched system constructed from the 2D convection-diffusion equation
Consider 

$$ u_t - \nu_{\sigma(t)}\Delta u + \boldsymbol{b} \nabla u=f_{\sigma(t)} \quad \text{in}\ [0,1]^2\times[0,T] $$

with zeros initial value condition and homogeneous Dirichlet bounday condition.
The diffusion parameter $\nu_{\sigma(t)}$ and the source term $f_{\sigma(t)}$ switch upon the time. Set $\sigma(t)=i$
